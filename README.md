# Flutters

A cross-platform chat app developed with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com)

### Tell me more...

Works on both Android and iOS sharing 100% of the code! (automatically generated boilerplate code of course is not included in that number)  
Zero back-end code! (well, except a few security rules but who counts those)  
Requires a Google account to post (stalking is always free and anonymous. Promise!)  

### But what can it do?

Chat in real time with unlimited number of people (or bots)  
Share images  

### Is that all?

Well, yeah! The whole app is less than 384 lines of code (including the UI!). What did you expect?
